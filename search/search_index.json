Many of these problems arise due to the fundamental mismatch between the data-centric usage of the Internet and the host-centric nature of IP. NDN is designed as a data-centric replacement of the TCP/IP architecture, thus overcoming this mismatch by replacing the network layer itself. The NDN project is now a collaborative effort of a large community of researchers at more than a dozen institutions.</p> <p>NDN retains the Internet's hourglass architecture but evolves the thin waist to allow the creation of completely general distribution networks. The core element of this evolution is removing the restriction that packets can only identify communication endpoints. As far as the network is concerned, the identifier in an NDN packet can be anything \u2014 an endpoint, a chunk of movie or book, a command to turn on some lights, etc. This conceptually simple change allows NDN networks to use almost all of the Internet\u2019s well understood and well tested engineering properties to efficiently solve not only communication problems but also digital distribution and control problems.</p> <p>A more detailed discussion can be found at the website of the NDN project (named-data.net)</p> <p>The design of NDN naturally leads to several advantages over IP and IP-based protocols. Some of these are briefly described below.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Data-Centric Security: NDN provides data-centric security<sup>2</sup> where it secures data directly rather than relying on securing the channels that transmit the data. Each packet of data carries a cryptographic signature that binds the name, contents and the identity of the producer of the data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Privacy: NDN provides privacy by allowing consumers to retrieve data without needing to expose their identity to the network. This is in contrast to IP where the source and destination addresses are exposed in every packet.</p> </li> <li> <p>Name-based Forwarding: NDN packets are routed and forwarded using their names. This allows NDN routers to make forwarding decisions based on application semantics rather than just network addresses. This also directly provides support for anycast for applications.</p> </li> <li> <p>Intelligent Data Plane: NDN utilizes a stateful forwarding plane where forwarders track the requests and responses of data. This allows NDN to support a wide range of advanced features such as adaptive and multipath forwarding, and provides DDoS protection<sup>3</sup> and congestion control<sup>4</sup> at the network layer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Multicast and Caching: The stateful forwarding plane allows for aggregation of requests and responses, which enables efficient multicast of all Data packets. Since NDN packets are individually secured and do not rely on channel security, data is also securely cached at every forwarder in the network, creating a massive distributed cache.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The NDN project also maintains a large open source code base, with NDN forwarders, debugging tools and libraries available in multiple languages including C++, Python, Go, TypeScript etc. Most of this code is available at GitHub.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Zhang, L. et al.\u00a0\u21a9 <li> <p>Zhang, Z. et al. 2018.

A face may, for instance, be backed an actual ethernet interface or it tunnel over a UDP or TCP connection.

Thus, building an NDN network consists of two steps:</p> <ol> <li>Configuring faces at each forwarder to each neighbor of that forwarder.

As a result, consumers can directly fetch the chain of certificates needed to verify a given data till they reach a root of trust.</p> <p>In the above example, if <code>jeff</code> receives a data object <code>website</code> from <code>lixia</code>,</p> <ol> <li><code>lixia</code> signs the data with the <code>/edu/ucla/cs/faculty/lixia</code> key, received by <code>jeff</code>.</li> <li><code>jeff</code> fetches the <code>/edu/ucla/cs/faculty/lixia &lt;= /edu/ucla/cs</code> certificate using the <code>KeyLocator</code> in the data.</li> <li><code>jeff</code> verifies the signature on the data with the public key in the certificate.</li> <li><code>jeff</code> fetches the <code>/edu/ucla/cs &lt;= /edu/ucla</code> certificate using the <code>KeyLocator</code> in the certificate.</li> <li><code>jeff</code> verifies the signature on the first certificate.</li> <li><code>jeff</code> verifies the second certificate, which is signed by a known trust anchor.</li> <li>The chain of verification is now complete, and <code>jeff</code> has successfully authenticated that <code>lixia</code> originally produced the data.</li> </ol> <pre><code>flowchart TD\n    /edu/ucla --&gt;|signs| /edu/ucla/cs\n    /edu/ucla --&gt;|signs| /edu/ucla/remap\n\n    /edu/ucla/cs --&gt;|signs| varun{{/edu/ucla/cs/students/varun}}\n    /edu/ucla/cs --&gt;|signs| lixia{{/edu/ucla/cs/faculty/lixia}} --&gt;|signs| lws([/edu/ucla/cs/faculty/lixia/website])\n    /edu/ucla/remap --&gt;|signs| jeff{{/edu/ucla/remap/faculty/jeff}}\n\n    lws -. fetched by .-&gt; jeff</code></pre> <p>Identity in WebPKI</p> <p>In the traditional WebPKI trust model, the unique identity is typically provided by the DNS system, and authentication is provided by one or more \"trusted\" certificate authorities. This means, however, that all trust between communicating entities depends on the implicit trust they have in these certificate authorities, typically by virtue of having certificates pre-installed in the operating system.</p>"},{"location":"security/trust-model/#trust-policy","title":"Trust Policy","text":"<p>Once every communicating entity has an identity, consumers can know who they are talking to. However, they still need to know what the other entity can say. This information is systematically encoded in a trust policy defined by the application.</p> <p>In NDN, a trust schema defines an application or organization's trust policy using a trust language such as Light Versec<sup>3</sup>. One or more trust languages are supported by all major NDN implementations.</p> <p>The trust schema defines which producer (by name) is allowed to generate what data. Typically, the trust schema is defined hierarchically, utilizing the name semantics of the application.</p> <p>To illustrate the usage of a name-based trust policy, we utilize the same UCLA example described above. Let us assume that the following policy must be enforced by the organization.</p> <ol> <li>All CS faculty can open all doors in the Engineering 6 building.</li> <li>Everyone in the CS department can turn on lights in Engineering 6.</li> <li>All faculty in UCLA can open doors on Floor 5 in Engineering 6.</li> </ol> <p>Such a trust policy can be written as a simple NDN trust schema as described below. Note that the pseudo-sytax is very similar to Light Versec, but is described in a verbose format for ease of understanding.</p> <pre><code>// Each line below is a policy \"rule\" - a definition of who can say what.\n// The pseudo syntax is similar to Light Versec and describes:\n//\n//   #rule_name: /what/data/is/this &lt;= /who/can/say/this\n//\n// We must first define the certification hierarchy in the application.\n// We start by definining the root of trust of the organization.\n#ucla: /\"edu\"/\"ucla\"\n\n// Rules may now refer to previously defined rules.\n//\n// Here, we define the name structure of a department, and declare that it\n// must be signed by the root of trust. The #KEY component refers to NDN's\n// pre-defined certificate naming convention.\n//\n// Since `dept` is not in quotes, it refers to a wildcard name component.\n// Thus, UCLA can now sign new departments with the root key without changing\n// the organization-wide trust policy.\n#department: #ucla/dept/#KEY &lt;= #ucla/#KEY\n\n// The next rule defines name structure for students and faculty, and declares\n// that these must be signed by the department they belong to.\n//\n// In this rule, notably, since #department is used in both the rule and the\n// signer definition, the wildcard components must match during verfication.\n// This means that the `/edu/ucla/remap` key cannot sign the certificate\n// for /edu/ucla/cs/students/varun\n//\n// Note that this structure is not rigid. For example, additional rules may\n// define some rule exceptions, such as where certain faculty certificates\n// may be signed by other departments.\n#students: #department/\"students\"/name/#KEY &lt;= #department\n#faculty: #department/\"faculty\"/name/#KEY &lt;= #department\n\n// Finally we define the naming structure for devices in UCLA facilities.\n// To allow one room to have multiple lights, we define an unnamed wildcard\n// component with `_`, which can match anything.\n#room: #ucla/\"facilities\"/building/floor/room\n#door: #room/\"door\"\n#light: #room/\"light\"/_\n\n// We can now define our actual device-control trust policy.\n//\n// \"All CS faculty can open all doors in the Engineering 6 building.\"\n//\n// To define this policy, we restrict the `building` variable to a particular\n// value, and define the entities allowed to say the \"open\" command by\n// restricting the `dept` variable in the signers.\n#cs_faculty: #faculty &amp; { dept: \"cs\" }\n#policy1: #door/\"open\" &amp; { building: \"eng6\" } &lt;= #cs_faculty\n\n// \"Everyone in the CS department can turn on lights in Engineering 6.\"\n//\n// We use two wildcards for the \"cs_all\" rule, the first to allow\n// any type of person (student or faculty), and the second to allow any\n// name. There are many different ways to write the same rule in a trust\n// language, and the rule below is only representative.\n#cs_all: #department/_/_/#KEY &amp; { dept: \"cs\" }\n#policy2: #light/\"on\" &amp; { building: \"eng6\" } &lt;= #cs_all\n\n// \"All faculty in UCLA can open doors on Floor 5 in Engineering 6.\"\n//\n// Once the naming structure is well-defined, additional complex rules\n// can be easily added using the trust schema rules syntax.\n#policy3: #door/\"open\" &amp; { building: \"eng6\", floor: \"floor-5\" } &lt;= #faculty\n</code></pre> <p>Once a trust policy is defined as a trust schema, NDN client libraries can automatically enforce the policy on all received data. For example, if the schema above is installed in all devices in UCLA, a door in Engineering 6 can automatically verify if the entity sending an \"open\" command is authorized to perform this action.</p> <p>Two important features of a schematized trust policy may be noted below.</p> <ol> <li>Additional certificates can now be issued without modifying the policy. For example, new students in the CS department can be issued a certificate with the correct naming structure, and they are automatically granted access to use lights in the E6 building. Schematizing the trust policy eliminates the need to maintain complicated ACLs.</li> <li>The trust policy establishes relations directly between users and the devices, without the requirement of a trusted identity provider. This eliminates the single point of failure, and the system continues to function even when disconnected from the public internet, e.g. in ad-hoc or air-gapped scenarios.</li> </ol> <ol> <li> <p>Zhang, Z. et al. 2018.
