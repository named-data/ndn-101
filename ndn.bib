	abstract = {Named data networking (NDN) can improve the consumer data retrieval throughput with its built-in multicast data delivery, innetwork caching, and ability to support multi-path forwarding. However, their realization brings challenges. In this work, we first examine how multi-path forwarding and in-network caching can interfere with consumer measurements for congestion control. Based on the results, we propose a congestion control solution, NDN-QSF, that can work effectively in the presence of in-network caching. In NDN-QSF, forwarders estimate upstream bandwidth and use queue size as congestion feedback to inform downstream routers to limit interest transmission rates. We further adapt and extend NDN-QSF to enable routers to make informed multi-path forwarding decisions. We evaluated NDN-QSF through simulation experimentation and our results show that NDN-QSF can effectively control congestion by using queue size as congestion feedback and improve network throughput with multi-path forwarding.},

YaNFD features multi-threaded forwarding, a smaller and more streamlined codebase compared to existing implementations, and can be managed using existing NDN forwarder management utilities and protocols. In this paper, we discuss our implementation, including how it differs from previous forwarders based upon lessons learned during their development and use over the span of multiple years. Additionally, we present the lessons learned from our experience developing a new forwarder for NDN from the ground up.},

	abstract = {Since the Named Data Networking (NDN) data plane requires name-based lookup of potentially large tables using variable-length hierarchical names as well as per-packet state updates, achieving high-speed NDN forwarding remains a challenge. In order to address this gap, we developed a high-performance NDN router capable of reaching forwarding rates higher than 100 Gbps while running on commodity hardware. In this paper we present our design and discuss its tradeoffs. We achieved this performance through several optimization techniques that include adopting better algorithms and efficient data structures, as well as making use of the parallelism offered by modern multi-core CPUs and multiple hardware queues with user-space drivers for kernel bypass. Our open-source forwarder is the first software implementation of NDN to exceed 100 Gbps throughput while supporting the full protocol semantics. We also present the results of extensive benchmarking carried out to assess a number of performance dimensions and to diagnose the current bottlenecks in the packet processing pipeline for future scalability enhancements. Finally, we identify future work which includes hardware-assisted ingress traffic dispatching, dynamic load balancing across forwarding threads, and novel caching solutions to accommodate on-disk content stores.},

NDNoT provides solutions to auto configuration, service discovery, data-centric security, content delivery, and other needs of IoT application developers. Utilizing NDN naming conventions, NDNoT aims to create an open environment where IoT applications and different services can easily cooperate and work together.

	abstract = {In Named-Data Networking (NDN), all packets are encoded in the Type-Length-Value (TLV) format. TLV encoding and decoding are implemented in every NDN library, and used by all applications and forwarders. Therefore, formal analysis of TLV encoding can assist NDN software development in the simplification of the code base, analysis of the performance, and improvement of robustness.In this paper, we want to bring attention to the subtleties of TLV encoding. As an initial result, we develop a type-theoretical model of TLV encodable types, and give an algorithm to automatically derive encoding and decoding functions. We formally prove that the derived encoding and decoding functions are inverse to each other. To evaluate the practicality of automatically derived algorithms, we implement the proposed algorithms in C++ templates and evaluate them in three aspects: performance, memory usage, and code complexity. Our results show that our C++ library is competitive in these three aspects. Though our implementation is not fully automated, we show that it is possible to have a fully automated library in future that correctly produce the encoding and decoding functions. We also discussed the limitations of our model and problems worth attention. We hope our work can offer a starting point of further research on TLV, especially formal analysis and automated implementation.},

	abstract = {In Named Data Networking (NDN), packets carry data names instead of source and destination addresses. This paradigm shift leads to a new network forwarding plane: data consumers send Interest packets to request desired data, routers forward Interest packets and maintain the state of all pending Interests, which is then used to guide Data packets back to the consumers. Maintaining the pending Interest state, together with the two-way Interest and Data exchange, enables NDN routers’ forwarding process to measure performance of different paths, quickly detect failures and retry alternative paths. In this paper we describe an initial design of NDN’s forwarding plane and evaluate its data delivery performance under adverse conditions. Our results show that this stateful forwarding plane can successfully circumvent prefix hijackers, avoid failed links, and utilize multiple paths to mitigate congestion. We also compare NDN’s performance with that of IP-based solutions to highlight the advantages of a stateful forwarding plane.}
